# Hi there 👋! 

My name is Maris and I'm a junior software developer, living in Tallinn, Estonia. 
I'm currently passionate about learning front-end technologies and frameworks like Angular and JS. Also Ionic and TypeScript.

From this year I decided to challenge myself with new opportunities and opted for a career change.
🌱 I’m currently self-learning through Coursera and passing different developer courses from universities all over the world 🌎.
When I'm not developing or learning new things, you can find me out running 🏃, playing tennis 🎾 or enjoying good music(and singing along)🎙️.

⚡ Fun fact: I sneeze every time i chew a gum that has peppermint in it!
